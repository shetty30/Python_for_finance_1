## 1. Time Value of Money (TVM) Calculations
- Calculated **Future Value (FV)** and **Present Value (PV)** using compound interest formulas.
- Determined **per annum compound interest rate** from cash flow data.
- Computed **Net Present Value (NPV)** for projects evaluating investment profitability.
- Implemented **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** calculations using iterative and built-in functions.
- Calculated **Yield to Maturity (YTM)** on bonds with given coupon payments and prices.

---

## 2. Python Programming Fundamentals
- Defined and used **variables**, understanding different data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans.
- Manipulated **lists and tuples**: creation, indexing, slicing, immutability of tuples.
- Worked with **dictionaries**: storing key-value pairs, accessing, and iterating over items.
- Used **loops** (`for`, `while`) to iterate through data and perform computations.
- Applied **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) for decision making.
- Explored **string operations**: indexing, uppercase conversion, and string formatting.

---

## 3. Advanced Python Techniques
- Created **copies of lists** to avoid unintended mutations (best practices).
- Explored **floating point precision** and rounding issues in Python.
- Applied **modulo operator (%)** for divisibility checks and flow control.
- Used **list comprehension** and **built-in functions** (`sum()`, `len()`, `max()`) for concise coding.

---

## 4. Numerical Computing with NumPy
- Created **NumPy arrays** for efficient numerical computation.
- Performed **vectorized operations**, such as conversions and cash flow calculations.
- Conducted slicing and Boolean filtering on arrays with logical operations.
- Utilized **numpy_financial** library for advanced financial calculations (NPV, IRR, PMT, PPMT).
- Calculated **cumulative sums** and statistical summaries easily.
- Applied **Matplotlib** for creating and customizing plots (line, scatter) to visualize financial data.

---

## 5. Financial Modeling and Capital Budgeting
- Evaluated project **NPV and IRR** to aid investment decisions.
- Compared mutually exclusive projects and calculated crossover rates.
- Modeled **amortizing loans**: calculated monthly payments and amortization schedules.
- Planned long-term investments considering payout and funding phases.
- Analyzed bond pricing and yields to maturity.

---

## 6. Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- numpy_financial
- Matplotlib

---

## 7. Skills Developed
- Ability to code financial math solutions programmatically.
- Understanding of Python core programming concepts with practical applications.
- Mastery of NumPy for numerical efficiency and matplotlib for visualization.
- Practical experience with investment project evaluation using TVM, NPV, IRR, and YTM.
- Analytical thinking for financial decision-making and problem solving.
