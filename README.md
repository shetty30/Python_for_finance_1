This repository contains a series of Python coding exercises designed to enhance understanding and practical skills in financial calculations, programming fundamentals, data manipulation, and visualization. The exercises span topics relevant to finance and quantitative analysis using Python, including Time Value of Money (TVM), loops, conditionals, data structures, numerical computing, and plotting.

Key Learning Areas
1. Time Value of Money (TVM) Calculations
Future Value and Present Value: Computation of future and present values using compound interest formulas.

Compound Interest Rate: Calculating annualized compound interest given initial and final values.

Net Present Value (NPV): Discounting multiple cash flows using different discount rates to evaluate investment viability.

Internal Rate of Return (IRR): Implementation of iterative methods and use of libraries to estimate IRR.

Yield to Maturity (YTM): Calculating bond yields using cash flows and pricing.

2. Python Programming Fundamentals
Variables and Data Types: Handling integers, floats, strings, booleans, and understanding mutability (e.g., tuples vs lists).

Lists and Tuples: Creating, indexing, slicing, mutating lists; understanding tuple immutability.

Dictionaries: Storing and retrieving key-value data, iterating with formatted strings.

Loops: For loops for iteration, accumulating values, printing intermediate results.

Conditionals: If-else statements, logical operators (and, or, not), and control flow with break.

While Loops: Repeating operations while conditions hold true for problem solving (e.g., finding divisible numbers).

3. Advanced Python Techniques
List Comprehension and Copying: Creating new lists efficiently, avoiding unintended side effects by copying objects.

String Operations: Indexing characters, uppercase conversion, string formatting.

Floating Point Precision: Understanding floating-point arithmetic issues in Python, rounding effects, and decimal representation.

4. Numerical Computing with NumPy
Arrays and Vectorization: Creating arrays, performing element-wise operations without explicit loops.

Filtering and Slicing: Using boolean masks for filtering data based on conditions.

Financial Calculations: Utilizing numpy_financial for NPV and IRR calculations.

Cumulative Sums and Statistics: Calculating cumulative cashflows and aggregate metrics easily.

Plotting with Matplotlib: Creating basic and customized line and scatter plots for financial data visualization.

5. Financial Modeling and Capital Budgeting
Project Evaluation: Comparing mutually exclusive projects using NPV and IRR metrics.

Loan Amortization: Calculating monthly payments and amortization schedules for mortgages.

Investment Planning: Modeling funding and payout phases for retirement savings using financial functions.

Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.x

NumPy: Numerical computations and array operations.
